C               G      C
You've got a friend in me
F                      C
You've got a friend in me
F          C       E7        Am
When the road looks rough ahead
             F         C               E7       Am
And you're miles and miles from your nice warm bed
F            C               E7       Am
You just remember what your old pal said
      D7            G          C
Boy, you've got a friend in me
A        D7          G       C       Am      A      C      G
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

C             G        C
You've got a friend in me
F                      C
You've got a friend in me
F          C
You got troubles
E7              Am
And I got them too
F        C
There isn't anything
  E7       Am
I wouldn't do for you
 F            C           E7        Am
We stick together, we can see it through
       D7            G       C       A
Cause you've got a friend in me
D7             G        C
You've got a friend in me
F                             B
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
C           B7        C
Bigger and stronger too, Maybe
B
But none of them
      B7
Will ever love you
    Em    A7
The way I do
      Dm     G
It's me and you, boy
C                G  C
And as the years go by,
       F                   C
Our friendship will never die
F                         C   E7 Am
You're gonna see it's our des-ti-ny
D7                G          C        A
You've got a friend in me
D7              G      C        A
You've got a friend in me
D              G       C      E7    Am   A   C   G    C
You've got a friend in me
