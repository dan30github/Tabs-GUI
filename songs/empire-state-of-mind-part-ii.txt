Alicia Keys - Empire State Of Mind (Part II)

F#        B7M
Ooohh New York   (2x)


F#                                                        B7M
  Grew up in a town that is famous as the place of movie scenes
F#                                                                      B7M
  Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
F#                                                                B7M
  If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
F#                                                                  B7M
  Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway


A#
  Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams



Baby, I'm from...


(refrão)
 B7M
  New York
                                  F#
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
                    C#
There's nothing you can't do
               B7M
Now you're in New York
                                  F#
These streets will make you feel brand new
                   C#
Big lights will inspire you
                   B7M
Let's hear it for New York, New York, New Yoooork!


F#                                                          B7M
  On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
F#                                                                 B7M
  Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
F#                                                             B7M
  Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
F#                                                              B7M
  Some will sleep tonight with a hunger for more than an empty fridge


A#
  I'm gonna make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Chorus:


Baby, I'm from...

One hand in the air for the big city,
                                             C#
Street lights, big dreams all looking pretty

No place in the world that can com-pare

Put your lighters in the air, everybody say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
