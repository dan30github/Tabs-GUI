John Lennon - Stand By Me

(intro) A  F#m  D E7  A

          A            A4 A A9 F#m
when the night has come,           and the land is dark,
        D            E7           A      A4  A
and the moon is the only light we'll see.
                             F#m
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid,
        D             E7         A
just as long as you stand, stand by me.

                         A          F#m
So, darling, darling, stand by me, oh, stand by me.
       D                  E7              A
Oh, stand,     stand by me,     stand by me.


      A                    F#m
If the sky that we look upon    should tumble and fall,
      D                E7             A
or the mountain should crumble to the sea.
                                  F#m
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear,
       D            E7         A
just as long as you stand, stand by me.

(refr達o 2x)

            A                       F#m
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me,
       D
Oh now now stand by me
E7              A
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me
A                               F#m
Darlin', darlin', stand by me-e, stand by me
E7               A
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me.
