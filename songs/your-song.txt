Elton John - Your Song

Intro: Eb   Ab/Eb   Bb/Eb   Ab/Eb

Estrofe 1:


Eb                   Ab7M  Bb/D                Gm7
  It's a little bit funny      this feeling inside
Cm7              Cm/Bb         Am7(b5)      Ab7M
  I'm not one of those who can       easily hide
Eb/Bb                 Bb   G/B             Cm
   I don't have much money    but boy if I did
Eb               Fm        Ab              Bb
  I'd buy a big house where  we both could live


Eb           Ab7M    Bb/D               Gm7
  If I was a sculptor    but then again  no

     Cm7          Cm/Bb        Am7(b5)          Ab7M
Or a man who makes potions in a      travelling show
Eb/Bb               Bb               G/B        Cm
   I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
Eb              Fm         Ab                    Eb   Eb/G
  My gift is my song, yeah,  and this one's for you


Refrão:


Bb/D                Cm        Fm             Ab
   And you can tell everybody   this is your song
Bb/D          Cm             Fm               Ab
   It may be quite simple but   now that it's done
Cm
  I hope you don't mind
Cm/Bb                   Am7(b5)                  Fm/Ab
   I hope you don't mind      that I put down in words
    Eb/G      Ab                          Bb
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


Instrumental: Eb   Ab/Eb   Bb/Eb   Ab/Eb

Estrofe 2:


Eb             Ab7M   Bb/D                   Gm7
  I sat on the roof       and kicked off the moss
      Cm7       Cm/Bb                   Am7(b5)      Ab7M
But a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
Eb/Bb                       Bb   G/B                   Cm
   But the sun's been quite kind    while I wrote this song
Eb                     Fm      Ab          Bb        Bb4  Bb
  It's for people like you that   keep it turned on


Eb               Ab7M    Bb/D                Gm7
  So excuse me forgetting    but these things I do
Cm7               Cm/Bb              Am7(b5)          Ab7M
   You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Eb/Bb                  Bb              G/B  Cm
   Anyway the thing is   what I really mean
Eb               Fm          Ab            Eb   Ab/Eb   Eb   Eb/G
  Yours are the sweetest eyes   I've ever seen


Refrão Final:


Bb/D                Cm        Fm             Ab
   And you can tell everybody   this is your song
Bb/D          Cm             Fm               Ab
   It may be quite simple but   now that it's done
Cm
  I hope you don't mind
Cm/Bb                   Am7(b5)                  Fm/Ab
   I hope you don't mind      that I put down in words
    Eb/G      Ab                          Bb
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

       Eb/G      Ab                           Bb
   How wonderful life is while you're in the world
