(intro) Dsus4 simult√¢neo e F maior com G na corda mizinha

             G    C9    G                    F              G
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog,
                  C9    G                   F              G
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log,
            C                            D
But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do,
              G   C9 G
Will make me feel alright.
            G   C9   G               F                 G
You know I work all day, to get you money to buy you things,
                           C9       G                 F             G
And it's worth it just to hear you say, you're gonna give me everything.



          C                                   D
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone,
               G   C9 G
You know I'll feel okay.


          Bm   Em                      Bm
When I'm home, everything seems to be right;
          G     Em                     C      D
When I'm home, feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah.


             G    C9    G                    F              G
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog,
                  C9    G                   F              G
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log,
            C                            D
But when I get home to you, I find the things that you do,
              G   C9 G
Will make me feel alright.
