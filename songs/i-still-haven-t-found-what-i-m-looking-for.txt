U2 - I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For

Intro 2x: G G5(7M)

         G                  G5(7M)
I have climbed the highest mountains
        G               G5(7M)
I have run through the fields
         C9         C4+(9)
Only to be with you
         G
Only to be with you
                    G5(7M)
I have run I have crawled
         G                G5(7M)            C9    C4+(9)
I have scaled these city walls, these city walls
         G
Only to be with you



        D            C9
But I still haven't found
                  G
What I'm looking for  (2x)


                     G5(7M)
I have kissed honey lips
          G                    G5(7M)
Felt the healing in her fingertips
    C9              C4+(9)
It burned like fire
                G
This burning desire
                                G5(7M)
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
        G                  G5(7M)
I have held the hand of a devil
                    C9   C4+(9)
It was warm in the night
                  G
I was cold as a stone


        D            C9
But I still haven't found
                  G
What I'm looking for  (2x)
                          G5(7M)
I believe in the Kingdom Come


              G
Then all the colors will
           G5(7M)
Bleed into one
         C9    C4+(9)
Bleed into one


                   G
But yes I'm still running.


You broke the bonds
                 G5(7M)
You loosed the chains
                  G
You carried the cross
        G5(7M)
Of my shame
         C9  C4+(9)
And my shame
              G
You know I believed it


        D            C9
But I still haven't found
                  G
What I'm looking for  (2x)
