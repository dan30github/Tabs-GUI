Bill Withers - Ain't No Sunshine

Intro: Am Em G  Am
                             Am    Em    G  Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                         Am      Em    G Am
It's not warm when she's away
                             Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                           Dm7
And she's always gone too long anytime
         Am     Em     G  Am
She goes away


                             Am     Em     G  Am
Wonder this time where she's gone

                        Am       Em     G  Am
Wonder if she's gone to stay
                             Em7
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                            Dm7
And this house just ain't a home
               Am     Em     G  Am
Anytime she goes away


Am
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know I know, I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave the young thing alone
                                Am    Em    G   Am
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone


                             Am    Em   Am
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
              Am    Em   Am
Only darkness everyday
                             Em
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
                             Dm
And this house just ain't no home
                Am7   Em7  Am
Anytime she goes away
                 Am7   Em7  Am
Anytime she goes away
                 Am7   Em7  Am
Anytime she goes away
                 Am7   Em7  Am
Anytime she goes away
