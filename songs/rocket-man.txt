Em                             Asus2       Em                 Asus2  G/B
She packed my bags last night, pre-flight,  Zero hour, nine a.m.
C               G/B  Am  Am/G                D
And I'm gonna be hi-i-igh    as a kite by then
Em                        Asus2          Em                    Asus2  G/B
I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife, it's lonely out in space
C         G/B   Am        Am/G  D
On such a ti-   i-imeless flight

G                                      C
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time

                                        G
Till touchdown brings me round again to find
                                     C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
           G/B       A7
Oh no, no, no, I'm a Rocket Man
C                                 G           C

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids, in fact its cold as hell
C                  G/B      Am         Am/G       D
And there's no-one there to raise them, if you did
Em                            Asus2      Em                        Asus2
And all this science, I don't understand, its just my job 5 days a week
  G/B    C  G/B  Am   Am/G        D
A Rocket ma- a- a- an,  Rocket man

Till touchdown brings me round again to find
                                   C
I'm not the man they think I am at home
            G/B      A7
Oh no, no, no, I'm a Rocket Man
C                                 G           C
